# GitHub Repository
Everything is hosted on GitHub. Here's a quick rundown:

1. The website (dareaquatics.com)
2. The website is deployed using GitHub Pages.

{: .note}
TeamUnify is NOT hosted on GitHub. That is seperate from dareaquatics.com (aka GitHub Repo).

## How it Works:
1. Edit File
2. Push the change to main
3. GitHub Actions recognizes that a change has been made and will automatically re-build the website. This usually takes around a minute to complete.

## GitHub Actions
What's GitHub Actions?
    
    GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
    
    Source: GitHub

## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages will deploy your website for free via Actions, onto the internet. 

**Limitations**:
- No server sided code
- Limited customization
